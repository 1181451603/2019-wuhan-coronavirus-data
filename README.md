# 2019 Wuhan Coronavirus data (2019-nCoV)

This public repository archives data over time from various public sources on the web.

Data is presented as timestamped CSV files, for maximum compatibility.

It is hoped that this data will be useful to those producing visualizations or analyses.

Code is included.

## Sample animation

Shown here in GIF format. There is a better (smaller/higher resolution) webm format also generated.

## Sample visualization

Generates static SVGs.

## Generating

### China

For a China map, the following command sequence will grab data from DXY and render it.

```
./build china
```

You now have timestamped JSON, CSV and SVG files in the `data-sources/dxy/data/` subdirectory.

### World

For a world map, the process is similar.

```
./build world
```

You now have timestamped CSV and SVG files in `data-sources/bno/data`.

## Software Dependencies

Probably an incomplete list:
 * bash
 * perl
 * php
 * imagemagick
 * ffmpeg
 * wget

## Sources used

### [BNO](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/01/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)

Includes detail on foreign sources, individual provincial update URLs. Updated once per day or so.
 * Data is timestamped in US Eastern Standard Time (ET) timezone
 * [Direct link to latest data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/globalcitizen/2019-wuhan-coronavirus-data/master/data-sources/bno/data/20200128-073300-bno-2019ncov-data.csv)

### [DXY](https://3g.dxy.cn/newh5/view/pneumonia)

High level information without specific source URLs. However, this is updated frequently and appears to be the best available data.

 * Data is timestamped in Beijing (CST) timezone
 * [Direct link to latest data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/globalcitizen/2019-wuhan-coronavirus-data/master/data-sources/dxy/data/20200129-094142-dxy-2019ncov-data.csv)

## TODO

 * Add key to global view
 * Convert disparate data sources in to singular SQLite database
 * Add cities (needs an improved visualization system)
 * More visualization options:
   * [amcharts](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/map-with-curved-lines/?theme=dark) (icky licensing but looks cool)
   * [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [d3-china-map](https://github.com/clemsos/d3-china-map) (good option but possibly overkill)
   * [jvectormap](https://jvectormap.com/) and [jvectormap china](https://jvectormap.com/maps/countries/china/) (good option but no cities)
   * [kartograph](http://kartograph.org/) (good option)
 * Add other sources, eg.
   * [National Health Commission daily reports](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml)
   * [Tencent live monitoring page](https://news.qq.com//zt2020/page/feiyan.htm)
   * [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak) (although it generally lags DXY on updates, the summary table is good for international data citations)
   * [Fuuuuuuu's map](https://maphub.net/Fuuuuuuu/map) which seems to have many international cases missed by BNO
 * Potential for different source SVGs, eg. [naturalearthdata](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/)
